# JenkinsFile
CI CD Code

This repository contains a Jenkinsfile that defines the stages of our CI/CD pipeline, covering everything from fetching the code to deployment.

We encourage you to review the pipeline and suggest any improvements or modifications you deem necessary. Once youâ€™ve made your changes, please feel free to raise a Pull Request (PR). I will review the proposed changes and merge them accordingly.
